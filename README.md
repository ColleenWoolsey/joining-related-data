PRACTICE: Small Business
A small business wants to keep track of its employees and the computers that they use. Each employee is assigned to a department, and they each get assigned a computer when they join the company.

1. Build arrays of objects that represent Employees, Departments, and Computers.
2. Assign every resource a unique id property.
3. Assign each employee to a department using a foreign key.
4. Assign each employee a computer using a foreign key.
5. Once your data is normalized, use your DOM skills to display a card for each employee. It should display the employee name, the name of their department, and which computer they are using
